# kubeadm - single master

**Note:** This is largely to replicate EKS but not necessarily for 1:1, such as changes where I just want to.

Some components are assumed to already be installed or on the instance, such as:
[AWS IAM Authenticator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator)
[kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm)
